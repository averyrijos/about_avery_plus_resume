## Professional Experience

### PROMETHIVM  
**Principal Consultant | Competitive Strategy, Cost Management, Process and Project Optimization**  
May 2025 – Present

I’m the founder and Principal Consultant of PROMETHIVM, where I blend deep systems thinking, project management, and process strategy with my philosophical commitment to contradiction-resilient design. I believe that every system — whether organizational, technological, or human — is an architectural site shaped by power, narrative, and imagination. My consulting work is rooted in the idea that tension and paradox are not obstacles to fix but vital sources of resilience and generative potential.

Drawing from my frameworks in Ontopolitical Architectonics and Posthumanist Phenomenology, I see process improvement and strategic planning as forms of world-making. Each engagement is an opportunity to transform inefficiencies and contradictions into adaptive, evolving workflows that unlock hidden value. In a world defined by complexity and constant change, I guide clients to build processes that are not just efficient but reflexive, resilient, and ethically grounded — maximizing their capacity to grow and reimagine what’s possible.

## Thought Leadership

### Ontopolitical Architectonics: Toward a Unified Theory of World-Making  
*Published Paper, PhilPapers Repository | [https://philpapers.org/rec/RIJOAT]*

- A meta-theoretical framework that reconceives reality as malleable architecture governed by semiotic codes, affective infrastructures, and mythic programs.
- Articulated a ten-axiom stack culminating in the universal ethical law *Good = d(OGI)/dt*, a metric for maximizing a system’s generative capacity.
- Practical applications: Designing systems that expand possibility and resilience; embedding continuous learning and redesign; using narrative and myth as levers for transformation.
- Advanced “Resistance as Redesign” and treated the self as an architectural site for iterative becoming.

### Posthumanist Phenomenology and Artificial Intelligence  
*Published Paper, PhilPapers Repository | [https://philpapers.org/rec/RIJAPA-3]*

• A cutting-edge inquiry into AI through posthumanist philosophy, reimagining identity, cognition, and agency beyond traditional frameworks.  
• Synthesized Deleuze, Foucault, and Haraway to critique AI’s epistemological foundations. Practical application: Diverse perspectives for ethical AI design.  
• Proposed negative augmentation as a productive force. Practical application: AI models that leverage absence and negative data.
