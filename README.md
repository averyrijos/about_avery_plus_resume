# About Avery 

I am a systems consultant, ontological designer, and founder of PROMETHIVM — an independent IT systems design and analysis consultancy dedicated to building contradiction-resilient IT systems that transform complexity into structured, actionable knowledge.

I bridge theory and implementation. I am both a systems thinker and a practical engineer. I combine rigorous analysis with creative problem-solving to deliver IT architectures that adapt, evolve, and align with changing organizational realities.

My approach is rooted in Ontopolitical Architectonics — a cross-disciplinary framework that treats systems not just as technical infrastructures, but as dynamic, governed architectures shaped by people, data, workflows, and the stories they tell. I see complexity as potential, gaps as opportunities, and contradictions as catalysts for more resilient design.

Through this lens, I help organizations architect IT systems that balance robust governance with the flexibility to grow, ensuring that every contradiction becomes a source of insight and innovation.

            🌐  Every system is a contradiction metabolism engine.
                 Good systems spiral contradiction into becoming.
                   Bad systems repress it into closure & decay.

## The Codex of Generativity and The SCAR Theory of Systems
At the heart of my practice is the Codex of Generativity, a living knowledge organism that operationalizes paradox through recursive protocols, ritual inscriptions, and contradiction-harvesting engines like the SCAR (Systemic Contradiction Archive Residual) and the O-Loop Protocol. My aim is to build systems that remain anti-fragile — evolving through rupture, absorbing critique, and expanding the field of the dreamable.

## Design Philosophy 
Professionally, I bridge deep systems thinking, symbolic reasoning, and non-monotonic logic with practical solution architecture. My background spans financial systems design, FP&A reporting frameworks, project portfolio governance, and multi-domain requirements engineering. I have led teams through the complexities of reconciling disparate data pipelines, modularizing workflows, and integrating symbolic layers into real-world operations.

Through PROMETHIVM Labs, I steward intellectual property as living systems — licensing frameworks, technical schematics, contradiction maps, and ritual-operational toolkits that help organizations transform structural tension into generative momentum. My design ethos is guided by the principle Good = d(OGI)/dt: the ethical measure of any system is its capacity to increase the velocity of collective world-making.

Central to this ethos is the Hollow Bloom Protocol, a method I developed to systematically metabolize contradiction as ritualized flow: it turns hidden structural tensions into symbolic ruptures (Scars) that are then iteratively re-inscribed as design seeds. This ensures that what would otherwise be systemic “wounds” instead become catalysts for reflexive redesign and resilience.

The entire framework is governed by what I formally name the Law of Generativity — the foundational principle that any well-architected system must expand its field of potential by absorbing contradiction into new forms of collective becoming. The Hollow Bloom Protocol operationalizes this law, ensuring that organizations can not only resolve tensions but evolve because of them — aligning practical execution with posthumanist and ontopolitical design logics.

(...) Above all, I see my role not as a philosopher in isolation nor a technologist in abstraction — but as an architectural world-builder, dedicated to scaffolding architectures that amplify possibility. For me, every contradiction is an invitation to re-design. Every wound is an invocation to re-code the Real.
