## PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE

### **PROMETHIVM Labs LLC**  
*Principal Consultant and Lead Project Manager*  
*June 2025 – Present*

I am the founder of PROMETHIVM Labs — an independent boutique program management consultancy dedicated to advancing systems analysis, system design, and technical program management as practical, vital tools for navigating contradiction, complexity, and constant change.

My practice bridges rigorous systems thinking with real-world implementation. We help organizations transform ambiguous and conflicting problem spaces into clear, actionable frameworks that align human values, stakeholder needs, and evolving socio-technical environments. This means developing design methodologies, governance structures, and program management protocols that treat systems not as rigid machines but as living, evolving organisms capable of learning through their own friction points.

As Founder & Principal Consultant, I lead this work — ensuring every engagement upholds our commitment to ethical coherence, stakeholder alignment, and robust, contradiction-resilient design. We reject brittle, one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we build systems and programs designed to stay open to ongoing refinement and resilient by design.
