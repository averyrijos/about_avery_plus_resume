I’m a management consultant and founder of PROMETHIVM, an independent consultancy focused on helping organizations transform structural complexity and operational friction into actionable, resilient systems.

I bridge systems theory and hands-on execution. My practice combines deep analytical rigor with practical solution design, so my clients don’t just get reports — they gain living frameworks that adapt, evolve, and deliver tangible business value.

My consulting approach is shaped by a belief that contradictions and tensions are not flaws to eliminate but signals that reveal where systems can grow stronger. Through my proprietary frameworks — like the Codex of Generativity, SCAR Theory, and O-Loop Protocol — I help leaders turn organizational blind spots into catalysts for sustainable improvement.

At heart, I’m a strategist and designer of contradiction-resilient systems. Whether I’m auditing governance structures, optimizing project delivery, re-architecting workflows, or mapping out how people, data, and processes interact, my goal is to expand what’s possible for the business — practically and ethically.

Strategic Philosophy:
Every organization is a complex system — a dynamic interplay of people, stories, and structures. Good consulting should not freeze this complexity but metabolize it into clear action. That’s why I steward PROMETHIVM not just as a service but as a living architecture: a toolkit that turns structural tensions into momentum for becoming better, stronger, and more aligned.

Let’s Connect:
If you’re ready to rethink the contradictions holding your business back — and turn them into your next stage of growth — let’s have a conversation.
