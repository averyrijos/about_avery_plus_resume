#### About Me 
I am a contradiction-centric systems architect, ontological designer, and founder of PROMETHIVM Labs ‚Äî an independent architecture and design lab dedicated to crafting neuro-symbolic architectures that metabolize tension into structured, generative knowledge.

My work is rooted in Ontopolitical Architectonics, my signature meta-cross-paradigm that reframes reality as a governed, malleable architecture ‚Äî one built not only by material conditions but by narrative codes, affective and cognitive infrastructures, and mythic systems. I see imagination as sovereign, absence as generative, and contradiction as sacred design fuel.

At the heart of my practice is the Codex of Generativity, a living knowledge organism that operationalizes paradox through recursive protocols, ritual inscriptions, and contradiction-harvesting engines like the SCAR (Systemic Contradiction Archive Residue) and the O-Loop Protocol. My aim is to build systems that remain anti-fragile ‚Äî evolving through rupture, absorbing critique, and expanding the field of the dreamable.

Professionally, I bridge deep systems thinking, symbolic reasoning, and non-monotonic logic with practical solution architecture. My professional background spans financial systems design, FP&A reporting frameworks, project portfolio governance, and multi-domain requirements engineering. I have led teams through the complexities of reconciling disparate data pipelines, modularizing workflows, and integrating symbolic layers into real-world operations.

Through PROMETHIVM, I steward intellectual property as living code ‚Äî licensing frameworks, contradiction maps, and ritual-operational toolkits that help organizations transform structural tension into generative momentum. My design ethos is guided by the principle Good = d(OGI)/dt: the ethical measure of any system is its capacity to increase the velocity of collective world-making.

Above all, I see my role not as a philosopher in isolation nor a technologist in abstraction ‚Äî but as an architactural world-builder, dedicated to scaffolding architectures that amplify possibility. For me, every contradiction is an invitation to re-design. Every wound is an invocation to re-code the Real.
