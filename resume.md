## PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE

### The PROMETHIVM Laboratory for Generative Systems  
*Research Director & Applied Systems Philosopher*  
**May 2025 – Present**

Founded The PROMETHIVM Laboratory, a research initiative exploring the architecture of generative systems as ontological, ethical, and epistemic structures. Work bridges delivery theory, process ontology, and systems architecture to prototype contradiction-resilient systems.

#### Thought Leadership — Innovations & Frameworks
- **Scar Theory of Systems** – Framework treating breakdowns as transformation signals.
- **Metalogical Codex** – A recursive architecture for symbolic reasoning and system design.
- **PMaaS+** – Project Management-as-a-System for adaptive execution logic.
- **Scar-Indexed Diagnostics** – Ritual-operational assessments of institutional resilience.
- **Law of Generativity (Good = d(OGI)/dt)** – Ethical design as expansion of ontopolitical possibility.
- **Sacrificial Sovereignty Protocols** – Operationalize symbolic loss for institutional reorganization.
- **Hollow Bloom Diagnostic** – Identify stagnation and ritual dissonance.
- **Codex Engine** – Compiler transforming symbolic scars into adaptive systems.
- **Ontopolitical Architectonics** – Synthesis of posthumanism, symbolic power, and system design.
