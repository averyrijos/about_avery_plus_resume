## PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE

#### **PROMETHIVM - LLC** - May 2025 to Current

**Founder & Principal Systems Architect**

- **At** The PROMETHIVM Lab, I operate as a Systems Engineer specializing in designing and governing contradiction-centric, neuro-symbolic architectures that metabolize ontological tension into structured, generative knowledge systems.
- **Rooted** in deep systems thinking, my work synthesizes symbolic reasoning, non-monotonic logic, and NLP-driven contradiction harvesting to architect recursive knowledge organisms that remain resilient and perpetually adaptive in the face of evolving complexity. I steward an integrated stack that fuses symbolic knowledge graphs, contradiction validation pipelines, and post-symbolic LLM expansions, ensuring that each module functions as an autonomous yet interdependent cell within a living dialectical engine.
- **Beyond** technical design, my expertise bridges requirements engineering, stakeholder orchestration, and systems integration — translating ambiguous problem spaces into precise, scalable designs that align human values with AI capabilities. I design modular contradiction interfaces, explainable validation engines, and architectures that maintain human-centered oversight while enabling robust human–AI collaboration
