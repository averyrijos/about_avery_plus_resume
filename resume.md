## PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE

#### **PROMETHIVM - LLC**

**Founder & Principal Systems Architect**

- **At** The PROMETHIVM Lab, I operate as a Systems Engineer specializing in designing and governing contradiction-centric, neuro-symbolic architectures that metabolize ontological tension into structured, generative knowledge systems.
- **Rooted** in deep systems thinking, my work synthesizes symbolic reasoning, non-monotonic logic, and NLP-driven contradiction harvesting to architect recursive knowledge organisms that remain resilient and perpetually adaptive in the face of evolving complexity. I steward an integrated stack that fuses symbolic knowledge graphs, contradiction validation pipelines, and post-symbolic LLM expansions, ensuring that each module functions as an autonomous yet interdependent cell within a living dialectical engine.
- **Beyond** technical design, my expertise bridges requirements engineering, stakeholder orchestration, and systems integration — translating ambiguous problem spaces into precise, scalable designs that align human values with AI capabilities. I design modular contradiction interfaces, explainable validation engines, and architectures that maintain human-centered oversight while enabling robust human–AI collaboration

**Career Break - March 2024 – April 2025**

#### **Abbott Laboratories (Short-Term Contract) — January 2024 to March 2024**

**Sr. Operations Analyst – FP&A (with Solution Architecture focus)**

- **Designed** and optimized end-to-end financial reporting architecture for a global unit generating ~$45M in monthly revenue, building standardized pipelines for daily, weekly, and annual reporting that improved consistency, traceability, and scalability.
- **Integrated** disparate data sources (SAP, QAD, ISS, and internal systems) into a unified reporting framework, enhancing data quality and providing stakeholders with a single source of truth for strategic decision-making.
- **Developed** robust reconciliation and validation frameworks (variance, sensitivity, scenario analyses) to ensure financial data integrity, aligning technical workflows with business objectives.
- **Architected** reporting modules to clarify variances and business impacts, ensuring alignment with month-end close cycles and mitigating risks from currency fluctuations, intercompany transactions, and accrual adjustments.
- **Led** continuous process reengineering within the APOC FP&A domain, mapping and refining month-end close processes to reduce cycle times while maintaining data governance standards.
- **Created** reusable templates and modular reporting components, driving automation and freeing up analyst capacity for higher-value analytical work.

**Fiserv, Inc. (Full-Time) — June 2022 to March 2023**

#### **Sr. Business Operations Analyst – Project Portfolio Management (with Solution Architecture focus)**

- **Orchestrated** the architecture and governance of an $80M enterprise project portfolio, designing frameworks to move initiatives from intake through execution while ensuring alignment with enterprise architecture standards and strategic goals.
- **Defined** and enforced portfolio governance models, risk frameworks, and decision matrices that streamlined project pipelines and improved cost efficiency.
- **Facilitated** architectural planning sessions with multi-functional stakeholders, translating complex business requirements into actionable project scopes, roadmaps, and solution designs.**’**
- **Built** reporting solutions that delivered up to $30K in cash flow benefits per project, connecting financial modeling with actionable insights for resource allocation and portfolio optimization.

**Bank of New York Mellon (Short-Term Contract) — March 2022 to June 2022**

#### **Jr. Operations Analyst**

- **Designed** and executed reconciliation workflows that ensured the accuracy of trading ledgers across multiple financial products, integrating multi-currency transaction systems to maintain data integrity for trades exceeding $50M daily.
- **Developed** exception handling modules to rapidly resolve discrepancies, embedding systemic controls that strengthened the architecture of daily financial operations.
- **Acted** as a key liaison between trading desks and back-office systems, facilitating real-time issue resolution and minimizing business disruption through robust communication protocols.
- **Conducted** root cause analyses to identify systemic flaws in data and process flows, feeding insights back into workflow designs that reduced recurring exceptions and increased system reliability.
- **Enhanced** departmental control frameworks by automating daily reporting controls, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and strengthening audit-readiness.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
          ⚙ CORE SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND ENGINEERING SKILLS — AVERY ⚙
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[ Contradiction-Centric Systems Design ]
 Design root-cause–oriented architectures that transform
 complexity into scalable, resilient solutions. Specialize in
 harvesting structural tension and metabolizing it as design fuel.

[ Solution Architecture & Integration ]
 Proven track record integrating disparate platforms and
 modular NLP/symbolic pipelines into unified, traceable systems
 that improve decision-making and compliance.

[ Neural-Symbolic Orchestration ]
 Pioneer hybrid frameworks combining LLM pipelines, contradiction
 maps, and symbolic reasoners for explainable, reflexive logic.

[ Requirements Engineering & Traceability ]
 Translate ambiguous business, regulatory, and operational
 requirements into version-controlled architectures and ADRs.

[ Knowledge Graphs & Symbolic Reasoning ]
 Develop contradiction-driven knowledge graph systems that
 transform organizational conflicts into actionable pathways.

[ Hollow Bloom Protocol ]
 Creator of the Hollow Bloom Protocol — a ritual-operational
 method for inscribing contradiction as symbolic scars and
 recursively redesigning systems for emergent resilience.

[ Law of Generativity ]
 Operate by the principle Good = d(OGI)/dt — measuring the ethical
 and practical strength of any system by its capacity to expand
 collective generative potential.

[ Process Re-engineering & Continuous Improvement ]
 Map, analyze, and refine workflows using Lean, Six Sigma, and
 dialectical redesign cycles that align with generativity ethics.

[ Data Pipeline Design & Modularization ]
 Design robust NLP pipelines, semantic extraction, and
 feature engineering modules with strong error control
 and redundancy prevention.

[ Risk, Compliance & Security Architecture ]
 Ability to build audit-ready controls, and compliance frameworks
 that ensure symbolic and operational integrity (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA).

[ FP&A Systems & Reporting Automation ]
 Re-architect financial reporting and variance pipelines with
 advanced reconciliation, risk mapping with real-time business intelligence software.

[ Technical Documentation & Stewardship ]
 Maintain contradiction maps, ritual compiler specs,
 and modular governance structures to scale
 contradiction-resilient systems in practice.
