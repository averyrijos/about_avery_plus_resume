## PROFESSIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE

#### **PROMETHIVM - LLC** - May 2025 to Current

**Founder & Principal Systems Consultant**

-At The PROMETHIVM Lab, I design, analyze, and manage complex IT systems across the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I specialize in bridging systems architecture with program management to ensure that every solution is scalable, resilient, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

- Rooted in deep systems thinking, my work focuses on requirements engineering, solution architecture, and integrated governance frameworks that keep projects adaptive and on track. I translate complex business objectives into clear technical roadmaps, oversee cross-functional teams, and maintain stakeholder alignment throughout the SDLC — from discovery and design through development, testing, and deployment.

- As both a systems analyst and technical program manager, I ensure that every project balances big-picture strategy with day-to-day execution, delivering robust IT systems that meet today’s complexity with clarity and accountability.

#### **Career Break - March 2024 – April 2025**

## Projects 

### 🜁 [PROMETHIVM Codex Engine](https://github.com/averyrijos/codex-of-generativity)
Role: Systems Architect

Designed and operationalized a contradiction-centric, neuro-symbolic architecture that metabolizes structural tension into resilient, adaptive frameworks.

Developed the Hollow Bloom Protocol, a ritual-operational method for inscribing structural contradiction as symbolic scars, enabling continuous reflexive redesign.

Formalized the Law of Generativity (Good = d(OGI)/dt) as a systems-level ethical measure, ensuring all architectures expand collective world-making capacity.

Delivered contradiction-driven knowledge graphs, SCAR feedback loops, meta-compiler pipelines, and ritual-operational toolkits as licensable IP for socio-technical and institutional clients.

### 🧩 Knowledge Graph–Driven Risk & Compliance Framework
Role: Systems Architect

Building a symbolic knowledge graph system to map and metabolize organizational contradictions tied to risk classification, compliance, and audit readiness.

Learned and applied non-monotonic logic, negative augmentation, and stakeholder contradiction loops as design inputs towards strengthening organizational resilience under changing regulatory constraints.

Integrated IAM/RBAC, secrets management, and domain-specific validation for GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA readiness in schematics, specifications, and requirements engineering.

### 🧠 Symbolic Reasoning & NLP Service Pipeline
Role: NLP Pipeline Designer (Data Engineering)

Engineered an NLP pre-processing pipeline feeding into a symbolic reasoner and contradiction validation layer, enabling explainable AI inference in dynamic knowledge domains. 

Structured the pipeline for resilience: batch processing, parallelization, robust fallback, and error trapping.

Produced maintainable module maps and ADRs to support cross-functional engineering and iterative system evolution.

Currently stress testing and looking to implement the blueprint in production environments.
